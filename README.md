## Objective
To develop a efficient and effective model which predicts the price of a used car according to userâ€™s inputs.
To achieve good accuracy.
To develop a User Interface( UI ) which is user-friendly and takes input from the user and predicts the price.

## Overview about the App
The Car Price Prediction is a flask web application which predicts car prices based on given independent features like Car_Name,	Year,	Selling_Price,	Present_Price,	Kms_Driven,	Fuel_Type,	Seller_Type,	Transmission, and Owner. The dataset is available at Kaggle, and it's provided by cardekho.com. The app predicts the price of used Cars trained on the top of Random Forest Regressor model. The dataset contains information about used cars is taken from   Kaggle listed on www.cardekho.com. The trained model takes a data of used cars as a input and predict the Price of the Car as a output.

The code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed, you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
